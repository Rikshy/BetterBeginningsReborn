[header=3][color=#ff0000]Notice[/color][/header]
[p][color=#ff0000]First off, I sincerely apologize for abandoning this mod for so long without any notice. You all deserve better than that, and I take full responsibility for any frustrations caused by this lack of communication to Daomephsta. I had a lot of personal issues at the time, but that is no excuse for leaving everyone in the dark and disappearing like I did. For now, I will be returning to this mod and try to update and continue this mod in a way that encourages compatibility and interaction with other mods.[/color][/p]

[p]BetterBeginnings started out with a goal of vanilla-like features with high compatibility. Over time though, I had added more and more features under the assumption that BB was the only content mod installed, and this has obviously led to very poor compatibility, contrary to my initial goals. I hope to return to that ideal with this mod in the future, and focus more on BetterBeginnings' place within a modded playthrough rather than trying to force it into a modpack's backbone. I also want to refocus development on the early-game, even if early-game is by modded standards rather than vanilla. Hopefully these features will make the mod more like Tiny Progressions and less like GregTech.[/p]

[header=1]BetterBeginnings Mod - Currently being updated to 1.12[/header]
[p]A mod to extend the beginning portion of Minecraft's early game and diversifying vanilla gameplay without breaking too much from the typical gameplay flow.[p]
[p]The early stage of Minecraft tends to be quick and easy. Punch three longs, make a crafting table, make a wood pick, mine three stone, and that's it. No more early game. With BetterBeginnings, you will spend much more time "on the move", simply trying to survive the terrifying world you live in. Punching trees? Wood tools? Haha...no. While this mod started as a purely early-game extension, it now adds a variety of features to aid and expand upon the vanilla playstyle.[/p]

[header=2]1.12 Update and Redesign[/header]
[p]This mod is in dire need of a rework. The current version is clunky and has poor compatibility. Its core design discourages its use in modpacks, and forces modpack authors to work far too hard to get this mod to pair well with other mods. With the update, I will be reverting the mod back to its alpha development state, as many severe changes, many of which will likely be game-breaking. Stability will have to come after the rework, once this mod can play nice with others.[/p]
[spoiler=Updating and catch-up todo][list]
[*]Update properly to MC 1.12. I will not update to 1.9 or even 1.10, as then I would be playing a game of catch-up or developing for two versions at once (not a good thing). No further updates will come to the 1.7.10 branch, even for bugfixes, at least not from myself. The 1.8 branch will become the 1.12 branch, so the 1.8 code will be moved to its own branch, though with no further updates from myself. The only 1.10 version will be the one developed by Daomephsta during my absence.
[*]Return mod status to "alpha" development as heavy changes are on their way.
[*]Redesign the old JSON recipe thing. JSON recipes are annoying and jank (sorry MC1.13), and far too verbose for modpack authors. Instead, the JSON recipe parser will be replaced by a built-in ZenScript parser, so modpack authors can copy BB-related code from MineTweaker as a quick and dirty alternative. This ZenScript parser will automatically disable itself if MineTweaker is detected during startup.
[*]Redesign kiln, brick oven, and smelter to be improvements to the furnace rather than replacements. This should greatly enhance compatibility without diverting too much from vanilla gameplay. All furnaces will be significantly sped up and otherwise improved to encourage use while still leaving room for higher-tier machinery by other mods, such as EnderIO and Thermal Expansion. The smelters in particular will require significant redesigns to neither be obsolete or overpowered.
[*]Remove advanced crafting from the default configuration, and balance the rest of the mod accordingly. While this was an interesting idea, and part of the core inspiration for the mod, this particular feature was incredibly problematic in many ways, and was very annoying to play with and to develop. It was buggy, difficult to balance, overly grindy, and a major pain for compatibility. This feature will become deprecated and no new features will be added to expand upon it.
[/list][/spoiler]

[header=3]1.7.10 and 1.8 Versions[/header]
[p]I will not be working on the original MC 1.7.10 version of the mod. 1.7.10 is extremely outdated, and only used in a few legacy packs now. However, Daomephsta has been working hard on maintaining it, and has released a few bugfixes over the past year. If you wish to continue development for that version, feel free to fork the code from its [url=https://github.com/Leviathan143/betterbeginnings-MC1.7]updated repository[/url].[/p]

[p]There will be no more updates to the MC 1.8 version of this mod. 1.8 is also very outdated, with little in the modding scene for it to be worth playing. If you wish to continue development for that version, feel free to fork its code from the [url=https://github.com/einsteinsci/betterbeginnings]original repository[/url].[/p]

[header=3]1.10.2 Version[/header]
[p]During my absence Daomephsta has updated BetterBeginnings to MC 1.10.2 and is working hard on it with active development for that version. This includes new features such as a wicker basket and shield for early game. While I will be focusing on the 1.12 version of the game, I will not be working on the 1.10.2 branch. Daomephsta instead will be continuing that branch as deemed necessary. If you wish to contribute, feel free to fork the code from the [url=https://github.com/Leviathan143/betterbeginnings-MODIFIED]maintained repository[/url].[/p]

[header=2]Feature Overview[/header]
[list]
[*]A variety of early-game tools to make you work to get that first stone pickaxe.
[*]Most blocks require the correct tool in order to be broken. No more punching trees!
[*]Three different furnaces are used in place of the vanilla furnace: The kiln, the brick oven, and the smelter. Each covers different purposes of smelting, with upgrades and recipes to reflect this.*
[*]Advanced, double crafting tables, to craft more complex items.*
[*]Infusion Repair, as a better, more reliable way to repair enchanted tools.
[*]Diffusion Extraction, to extract enchantments from tools.
[*]Campfires, for [s]cooking[/s] charring food to a crisp in the early-game.
[*]Config options with in-game toggle support.*
[*]JEI/NEI and Minetweaker/CraftTweaker support.*
[/list]
[p][size=small][i]* This feature will be heavily reworked with the 1.12 update for better compatibility and configurability.[/i][/size][/p]

[header=2]BetterBeginnings Wiki[/header]
[p]Full info can be found on the [url=https://github.com/Leviathan143/betterbeginnings-MODIFIED/wiki]GitHub wiki[/url]! Please note that this links to Daomephsta's repository. A new wiki on the 1.12 repository will be created once the update and rework is finished.[/p]

[header=2]FAQ[/header]
[spoiler=Please actually read this][header=4]Can I use this in my modpack?[/header]
[p]Absolutely. This mod is open-source under a copyleft license, so feel free to use it as you like. However, if you redistribute your modpack with the mod file included directly (rather than linked such as via Twitch), please link back to the source code of whichever version you're using, or this forum post. This ensures the source code is as accessible as the mod itself. While there's no requirement to ask or notify me, it would be nice to let me know about it; I might be interested in playing it.[/p]

[header=4]I found a bug! Where do I report it?[/header]
[p]You can report bugs on the issues tab for the version of the mod you're downloading, with the exception of 1.8. There will be no more official updates to the 1.8 branch of the mod - even for bugfixes.[/p]

[header=4]When will you update this?[/header]
[p]You're really not supposed to ask that question. If you're asking this, we're probably already working on it. When a new version of the game gets released, there's a big process that goes on before any actual updating goes on. First we have to wait for the Minecraft version to stabilize so that MCP and Forge can get to work without it getting undone a week later. Next is to wait on MCP to update, followed by Forge. Then we have to wait on Forge to have a stable version as well so we don't have to re-release the mod every week. Only then can we get to work. With large, heavily internal updates (such as 1.8), this can take a very long time.[/p]

[header=4]1.6.4 version?[/header]
[p]While 1.6.4 was a fantastic version for modding, arguably a "golden age", it is extremely old. Even by "legacy" standards, it's still very old. There are many great mods and modpacks from that version, but it's not worth the time for myself or Daomephsta to backport it, especially not with the 1.12 version on its way. If you want to and know how, feel free to backport it yourself from the source code.[/p]

[header=4]1.9/1.11 version?[/header]
[p]1.9 and 1.11 were too short-lived to be worth updating to. 1.12 is the current version of the game, the one mods are currently updating to. 1.10 is the current standard with large modpacks, as most mods for that version have become quite stable. 1.7.10 is the current "legacy" standard for old modpacks or old mods that never got updated past 1.8.[/p]

[header=4]The furnaces don't work with other mod's recipes! How do I cook a Harvestcraft meal in the Brick Oven?[/header]
[p]This is something I really want to get working properly in the upcoming rework. For now you can use CraftTweaker (1.10.2) or MineTweaker (1.7.10/1.8) to script the recipes in. Alternatively, if you are using the 1.8 or 1.10.2 versions of the mod, you can use the built-in JSON recipe system to set and replace the mod's recipes. (This feature will be removed in the upcoming rework, as it causes more problems than it fixes.)[/p]

[header=4]How do I light the campfire?[/header]
[p]Put the campfire down on the ground, put your item to be smelted in the top slot, with some [i]wooden[/i] fuel in the bottom (coal and charcoal won't work), and then you have to light it. You can light the campfire with either flint & steel or a BetterBeginnings fire bow. If the campfire starts smoking, it's out of fuel; put more wooden fuel in while it's still smoking or else you'll have to light it again.[/p]

[header=4]That's not how furnaces work in real life![/header]
[p]It's not supposed to be. Instead this mod aims for balance and what makes sense on a very basic level. Cooking meat in the same fires you use to smelt ores into ingots does not make sense.[/p]

[header=4]Is this mod compatible with _____?[/header]
[p]On a basic level, almost certainly. That's the whole point of Forge. However, for interaction-related bugs and oversights, those are likely to happen with a few mods. We will try to resolve those issues when we can.[/p]

[header=4]Ur mod suckz becus idk[/header]
[p]That's neither informative or helpful. What am I supposed to do with that?[/p][/spoiler]

[header=2]Mod Spotlights[/header]
[p]These mod spotlights, while informative for their versions, are all quite outdated at this point. They will become very inaccurate in the Reborn update.[/p]

[*]Knoxx093, for fixing some of the more troubling bugs, as well as cleaning up some of the less organized regions of the code.
[*]iLiminate, for helping code a large portion of this mod in its early stages. iLiminate has since left due to a lack of time, however.
[*]YiChenCraft, for the recent translation into simplified Chinese.
[*]Adaptivity, for help with version info and a translation into Russian.
[*][url=https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/]IntelliJ IDEA[/url], for being the best Java IDE.
[*][url=http://www.getpaint.net/index.html]Paint.NET[/url], because it's awesome. All my textures were made with it. Textures made by Daomephsta and iLiminate may have been made with other programs.
[*]The modding community at MCForums for helping me resolve countless issues.

[header=2]Contributing[/header]
[p]You can find links to the source code in several places scattered throughout this post, but here they are again just in case:[/p]
[list]
[*][b][url=https://github.com/Leviathan143/betterbeginnings-MODIFIED]MC 1.10.2 version, in active development by Daomephsta[/url][/b]. Currently this is the "main" branch of the mod.
[*][url=https://github.com/Leviathan143/betterbeginnings-MC1.7]MC 1.7.10 version, in bugfix-only maintenance by Daomephsta[/url]. This is in bugfix-only mode, so no new features will be added to this version. The only releases for 1.7.10 you will see are bugfixes and optimizations.
[*][url=https://github.com/einsteinsci/betterbeginnings]MC 1.8 version, abandoned last year for personal reasons[/url]. This version is not in active development by Daomephsta or myself. No new features, optimizations, or bugfixes will come to this version of the mod. However, you are free to fork this and continue it on your own if you see fit.
[*][url=https://github.com/einsteinsci/BetterBeginningsReborn]MC 1.12.x "Reborn" branch, currently in the early stages of being updated[/url]. This version of the mod will be updated to 1.12, followed by drastic changes to the features and code structure of the mod. Currently there are no releases yet for this branch. After the initial update release, this version will in alpha for quite some time, during which it will likely have game-breaking changes.
[/list]
[p]In all of these branches, feel free to submit a Pull Request (1.8 included) if you wish to help us make the mod better. In the versions with active development (not 1.8), feel free to submit an issue if you find a bug.[/p]

[p]We are also in need of a texture artist. Currently all textures are made by iLiminate, Daomephsta, and myself. None of us are texture artists, so we make due with what we can come up with. We also need a new logo, as the current one is too similar to a particular toy franchise's logo. A new logo needs to fit a horizontal banner shape - detailed enough to look good at the top of this thread, but small enough to fit in a signature without adding a scroll bar.[/p]

[header=2]Changelog[/header]

[*]Moved config file to its own folder. [b]Delete or move the old config file when updating.[/b]
[*]Reworked campfire. Rotisserie now cooks slower than without, and pan cooks faster. Base campfire speed buffed.

[*]Changed roasting stick recipe to use two sticks and a knife (shapeless).
[*]Changed rotisserie recipe to require two roasting sticks and two of either string or twine ("itemStringTough") in an X pattern (see NEI).
[*]Added ability to make twine out of tall grass and ferns.

[list]
[*]New versioning system. Releases for different versions of MC will have a letter attached indicating which part of the mod version. For example: "R1a" for MC 1.8.
[*]Added enchantment diffusion, a new mechanic using cloth and the repair infusion table. See info above (and wiki) for details.
[*]Renamed "Spit" to "Rotisserie". This will delete all spit objects in your world. However, as the item is extremely cheap, you almost certainly won't lose much at all.
[*]Block break requirement messages changed to use more human-readable tool tier names in 1.8, to match 1.7.10.
[*]Bugfix (MAJOR): Cannot craft diamond pickaxe as it requires blaze powder, which requires a nether portal, and thus obsidian, and thus a diamond pickaxe.
[*]Bugfix: Block-breaking mechanics now ignore fake players. This means no more crashing with BC Quarries.
[*]Bugfix: Knives consumed when used in crafting recipes at double workbench (bug was 1.8 only).
